# Diatonic Ruler

[This website](https://diatonic.netlify.app/) provides several setups (“presets”) of interactive diatonic rulers for music theory learners to explore the relationships among pitch, scale degrees and positions, and intervals that underlie concepts like keys, transposition, and more. The idea of the diatonic ruler expands on the Norwich Sol-Fa system invented by English music educator [Sarah Anna Glover](https://www.musicbywomen.org/theorists/sarah-ann-glover-1786-1867/) (1786–1867).

This website was designed and developed in late 2021/early 2022 by [Kat Huang](https://katmh.com/) with [Nathan Lam](https://nathanlam.com/) for MIT’s introductory [music theory courses](https://mta.mit.edu/music/class-schedule), 21M.051 and 21M.301. Also thanks to Max Wang for advice on both the technical implementation design and musical user experience. Feel free to report bugs by creating an issue on this repository, though there are currently no contribution guidelines or plans about active maintenance.
